# CRITTERPEDIA

A tool for Animal Crossing: New Horizons players who are curious to know what critters they can encounter on their island! The app allows the user to search for bugs, fish, or sea creatures on their island by specifying the hemisphere their island is in and the month. 

This project was made with HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

Lessons learned:
* Modals are not an accessible way to display info, and are rather intrusive to a user's experience. Often, they are used as interaction junk drawers. It is a far better idea to either place content on a different page or inline.
