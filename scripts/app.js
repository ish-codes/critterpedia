        // Record user's input on submit (event listener)
        // Create a URL object with specified params (e.g. query fish, query bugs, query sea creatures, etc.)
        // Fetch object, parse into JSON, this will return an object of objects (item)
        // Then use a for-each loop to iterate over each item and its properties, save all of these individual objects to an array
        // Use a filter method to take only the objects which have an availability (month-array-northern and month-array-southern) matching the user's specified month
        // Create a "li" element to display each "item" as a card using the following properties:
        // item.title, item.museum_fact, item.location, etc...
        // Add the information above to the li
        // Append the li to the end of the ul which will host each of the fish, sea creatures, and bug sections.
